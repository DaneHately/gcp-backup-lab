# my-ace-backup: Google Cloud Storage Backup Solution
*By Ember Cloud LLC*

## Overview
Welcome to the `my-ace-backup` project, one of my first projects, a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) lab demonstrating cloud storage automation, built by **IronKube Solutions**, a freelance cloud engineering consultancy specializing in Terraform and Kubernetes. This project showcases skills in GCP Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, and Pub/Sub, developed as part of preparation for the Google Associate Cloud Engineer (ACE) certification.

## Project Goals
- Design a scalable backup system using GCP Cloud Storage.
- Automate file management with lifecycle policies and serverless functions.
- Demonstrate proficiency in cloud infrastructure for freelance portfolio.

## Implementation
- **Cloud Storage Buckets**: Created `mock-client-data` (source) and `my-ace-backup` (destination) buckets in `us-central1` with uniform bucket-level access for simplified IAM management.
- **Bucket Lifecycle Policy**: Configured a 30-day lifecycle policy on `my-ace-backup` to auto-delete outdated files, optimizing storage costs.
- **Cloud Function with Pub/Sub**: Deployed a Python-based 2nd Gen Cloud Function (`process-file`) triggered by a Pub/Sub topic (`my-bucket-topic`) to copy files from `mock-client-data` to `my-ace-backup` upon upload.
- **Access Control**: Applied IAM roles (`storage.objectViewer`, `storage.objectCreator`, `pubsub.subscriber`, `cloudfunctions.invoker`) to the service account `my-ace-function@linux-practice-455701.iam.gserviceaccount.com` for secure operations.

## Key Learnings
- Mastered GCP services like Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Functions for real-world applications.
- Strengthened debugging skills by resolving permission and configuration issues, critical for client-facing work.
- Gained hands-on experience with serverless automation, a valuable skill for cloud infrastructure projects.
